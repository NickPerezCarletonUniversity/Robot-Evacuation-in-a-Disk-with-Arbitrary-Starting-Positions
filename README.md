This is the GitHub repository for my 4th year honours project. [Click here](https://service.scs.carleton.ca/content/honours-project-nicolas-perez-april-17-2019-1037am) for the official website of the project. 

This repository contains the PDF format of my project, as well as a zip file for compiling the PDF from LaTeX.

# Abstract
Imagine a scenario in which there are 2 robots which can move at
most 1 unit speed are placed inside of a room (AKA a disk) whose
perimeter is in the shape of a perfect circle of 1 unit radius. The 2
robots must find the exit along the perimeter and leave the room in
the shortest amount of time. In this project, I will examine this problem from a mathematical perspective, considering a ’perfect’ model
for simplicity and considering various sub-scenarios which determine where they are initially placed inside of the disk and how much
information they know about their initial placements. The robots can
only find the exit once they come into contact with it, and both robots
can communicate anything they know or have learnt about their environment to the other robots. This includes but is not limited to their
trajectory, their GPS coordinates, the location of the perimeter of the
disk (if it is known) and the exit to the disk (again, if it is known).
Using knowledge from various pieces of work on similar variations
of this problem as well as some of my own original work, I will
show algorithms for multiple variations of the problem which are
all proven to be at-most 1 unit of time off from optimal solutions. I
will also discuss a modified model for the problem as well as demonstrate methods for getting the expected run time of evacuation algorithm which both might be useful for future work on the evacuation
problem.
